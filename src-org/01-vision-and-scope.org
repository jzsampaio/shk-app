* Vision and Scope

This document was adapted from the ~Software Requirements~ book.

The product to be built will be referred to as SHK (Stronger and
Harder to Kill) App.

** Business requirements

SHK should allow the user to keep track of his progress on strength
training, while minimizing the amount of interaction with the mobile
device.

*** Background

Strength training is mostly about consistency following a workout
program designed to push the current strength boundaries of the
lifter. As lifters get stronger, more weight should be added to the
bar, and eventually new workout algorithms are necessary.

Keeping track of these workouts usually requires pen and papers. App
exist that will help the user. However, the apps that JZ tried all
require significant amount of interaction to get the job done. Also,
they don't link workout to videos. There exists tools that analyze
workout videos, but these are separate apps.

*** TODO Opportunity

   Describes the business opportunity that exists and the market in
   which the product will be competing. This section could include a
   comparative evaluation of existing products, indicating why the
   proposed product is attractive and the advantages it
   provides. Describe the problems that cannot currently be solved
   without the envisioned solution. Show how it aligns with market
   trends, technology evolution, or corporate strategic
   directions. List any other technologies, processes, or resources
   required to provide a complete customer solution.

*** Objectives

   | Financial                                 | Non financial                    |
   |-------------------------------------------+----------------------------------|
   | Reach 10 paid users on Google Store       | Get positive feedback from peers |
   | Make 100 USD on adds for the free version | Get a friend to use the app      |
   | Present this app on future job interviews |                                  |

*** Success metrics

As this is a portfolio project, I won't evaluate it in term of market
success, instead, I will run a survey through trusted fellow
engineers.


**** Survey

**** Open Ended Questions

- How would you improve this software system?
- What of this project caught your attention?

*** Vision statement

For weightlifters who want an efficient and thorough way to log their
workouts, the ~Stronger and Harder to Kill (SHK) App~ is a workout
logging system that minimizes contact with the mobile device while at
a workout. Unlike competitors, our product was built by a weightlifter
who really wants to avoid touching his cellphone while on workout.

*** Business risks


The biggest risk on this project is I not finishing it. This is a non
paid and self-proposed challenge. If the future is to repeat the past,
there is a chance I will want to give up after 10 days on this
project. By not completing this project, I will have wasted a ton of
time. I must take this at least to a point where I can present the
book on a job interview.

*** Assumptions and dependencies

- Assumptions
    * It should be easy to get an F# project running on Android
    * It should be easy to monetize my android app
- Dependencies
    * F# and Android ecosystem

** Scope and limitations

  States both what the solution being developed is and what it is not.

*** Features
**** Scope of initial release

- Lifter should be able to log his workout informing exercises done,
  as well as number of sets and reps
- Lifter should be able to attach video recordings of each set
- App should support multiple users
- App should support 10 concurrent users
- The user data should be accessible on mobile android device and on
  the web browser
    * Google chrome is enough

**** Scope of subsequent releases

Future releases might include:

- Video analyzes of the exercises
- App usable from a smart watch
- Capacity to play music
- Smart way for playing audiobooks/podcasts during recovery time
- Timer for HIIT workouts
- App should support a 100 concurrent users

**** Limitations and exclusions

Not necessarily this app will:

- Run on app devices

** Context

This section presents profiles of major stakeholder categories,
managementâ€™s priorities for the project, and a summary of some
factors to consider when planning deployment of the solution.

*** Stakeholders profiles

- Developer :: This is JZ, the sponsor of this project. He would like
  to know that the stuff that he preaches is actually good when put to
  practice. He would also like to become faster at putting this stuff
  to practice, so more people are convinced it is worth pursuing my
  path, and so the software industry becomes a more interesting place
  to live.
- Project Reviewer (Tecnical) :: These are the fellow engineers I will
  invite to evaluate my project. Candidates: Filipe Correia, Daniel,
  Bellani, Alesson, Wesley, Todd, Ataias, Lemos, Magueta, Renan, and
  Thales. As friends, I think they would like to contribute to my
  progress. As engineer, they would like to learn that such level of
  quality as the one proposed by this project is possible.
- App Reviewer (Lifter) :: These are lifters that I will invite to try
  my app. Candidates: Ataias, Luana, and "Senhor Tanquinho".
- Weightlifter :: This is the primary user of the system. He goes to
  the gym, he wants to get stronger, and he does not want to get hurt.
    * Brazilian Lifter :: This guys does not pay for apps. Will most
      likely use the free version
    * Gringo Lifter :: Has money and pays for apps.

*** Priorities

   To enable effective decision making, the stakeholders must agree on the
   project's priorities. One way to approach this is to consider the five
   dimensions of features, quality, schedule, cost, and staff.

   | Dimension | Priority (higher -> less flexibility) |
   |-----------+---------------------------------------|
   | Feature   |                                     1 |
   | Quality   |                                     5 |
   | Schedule  |                                     8 |
   | Cost      |                                     3 |
   | Staff     |                                    20 |

*** Deployment considerations

This product is a brand new solution. It should run on modern Android
versions (to be defined). The back-end should be salable to a thousand
concurrent users, though, since the budget is on me, the production
version should run on very cheap cloud vms.
